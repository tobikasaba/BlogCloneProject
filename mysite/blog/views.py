Glossary of terms, attributes and variables

LoginRequiredMixin: s a mixin provided by Django that is used to restrict access to a view, 
ensuring that only authenticated users can access it.  If a user is not logged in and tries to access a view that uses
this mixin, they will be redirected to the login page.

form_class: specifies which form to use for handling user input. This is particularly useful when creating or 
editing model instances through forms. The form_class attribute indicates which form to use when rendering 
the view and processing form submissions.

redirect_field_name: this attribute is used to specify the name of the query parameter that will hold the URL to which
the user should be redirected after logging in. This is particularly relevant when using the LoginRequiredMixin.
That is, after login in the user is redirected to the page specified by redirect_field_name

success_url: this attribute defines where users will be redirected after successfully completing an action on the view.
This is only done after the action on the view has been completed which in this case is deleting a post.

reverse_lazy: this is used to hard code success_url with the url that dynamically generates based on some criteria.

get_object_or_404(): This  used for getting an object from a database using a modelâ€™s manager.
It raises an Http404 exception if the object is not found. 
The Post object gotten is based on the primary key (pk) f the post.
This is particularly useful for ensuring the post with the pk exists before attempting to publish it.
